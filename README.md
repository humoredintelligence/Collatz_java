Found that if I used int, I couldn't use an odd number much bigger than 100M, as the number would eventually exceed the bounds of what int will allow. Decided to use long instead.  Allows a much larger number to be used.

Will still be limited on array size, but realistically, over 2 billion entries should be plenty of runnable numbers.
